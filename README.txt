Solo-voleibol is an android application that helps you keep track all the 
events that happen during a volley-ball match in order to be reviewed later
and build database of information. These statistics are important for every
volley-ball coach to see the strengths and weakness of the teams he/she 
trains.
It is designed to work very good with tables and cell-phones so you can't 
miss any match of your teams.
